This folder contains programs that test and build the first versions of the collision prediction and obstacle avoidance algorithms. They are built
in JavaScript because that is the language that I normally write programs in, so I can create, test, and debug much more quickly.

Currently, I have completed:

1) Ray tracing test for stationary obstacles and a linearly moving aircraft
2) Collision prediction between a linearly moving aircraft and MOVING obstacles

Current project: trajectory planning. ETA: Sunday March 30, 2014
