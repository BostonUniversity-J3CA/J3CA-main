These files are to test the ability of the collision detection by ray tracing. Open rayTracing.html (along with the other files) in a web browser to test it out. 

How it works:

1) Click the "Random Sphere" button to make a random obstacle
2) Click anywhere below the "Random Sphere" button to make a ray. The computer will alert either TRUE or FALSE depending on if a collision occurred or not.
