These files are to test the ability of the collision detection by ray tracing. Open rayTracing.html (along with the other files) in a web browser to test it out. 

The first version only tested the collision detection in 1D (along the x-axis only). This version will test the detection in both the x and the y directions. 

The actual test page will need to be changed such that draw a line through the circle is easy. Right now it's very difficult but possible.
