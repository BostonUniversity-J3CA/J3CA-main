These files are to test the ability of the collision detection by ray tracing. Open rayTracing.html (along with the other files) in a web browser to test it out. 

The first version only tested the collision detection in 1D (along the x-axis only). This version will test the detection in both the x and the y directions. 

To use:

1) Make a random circle using the "Random Sphere" button
2) Click the area below the button to set the first point
3) Click again to set the second point, this will make a ray
4) Move the mouse to move the ray
5) Click the area again to reset the points
