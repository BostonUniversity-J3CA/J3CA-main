Mass is 1.193 kg
Pitch moment of inertia is:
	.06 kg*m**2, from Solidworks model. (Density = 80 kg/m^3)
Elevator effectiveness is as follows:
	A = 33.5 cm * 3 cm = .01005 m**2	
	x = 57.5 cm
	L = 1/2 rho * v**2 * A * Cl= .0060501 kg/m * v**2 * Cl
	Torque = L*x = .0034788075 kg * v**2 * Cl
	Cl = 6*alpha
	Torque = .0034788075 kg * v**2 * 6 * alpha
	Torque = 020872845 kg * v**2 * alpha
